E-Commerce Backend is a backend API (surprise surprise) that makes use of CRUD operations for a general ecommerce website. The API is built with Express.js and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. There are endpoints for categories, tags, and products. Products belong to a single category but can have multiple tags, and tags can be attributed to multiple products.
